Generating Graphs from Adjacency Matrices

Generating a graph from an adjacency matrix involves transforming a mathematical representation of connections between nodes (vertices) into a visual representation of a graph or network. An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph, where the entry 
𝑎
𝑖
𝑗
a 
ij
​
  indicates whether there is an edge between vertex 
𝑖
i and vertex 
𝑗
j.
